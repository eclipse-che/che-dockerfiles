### Storage and user configuration
# The location where your workspaces (and their projects) are stored.
# This property works for Docker for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
# On virtualbox for windows, this property is ignored. Instead, they are stored at:
# c:\%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Eclipse Che\
che.workspace.storage=${che.home}/workspaces

# Your projects are synchronized from the Che server into the machine running each
# workspace. This is the directory in the machine where your projects are placed.
che.machine.projects.internal.storage=/projects

# Che stores various internal data objects as JSON on the file system.
che.conf.storage=${che.home}/storage

### Configuration of embedded templates and samples
# Folder that contains JSON files with code templates and samples
project.template_description.location_dir=${che.home}/templates

### Configuration of embedded stacks
#Path to predefined stacks json
che.stacks.default=${che.home}/stacks/stacks.json
#Path to folder with predefined stack icons
che.stacks.images.storage=${che.home}/stacks/images

### oAuth configuration. You can setup GitHub oAuth to automate authentication to remote
### repositories. You need to first register this application with GitHub oAuth.
# GitHub application client ID
oauth.github.clientid=NULL
oauth.github.clientsecret=NULL
oauth.github.authuri= https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
oauth.github.tokenuri= https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
oauth.github.redirecturis= http://localhost:${SERVER_PORT}/wsmaster/api/oauth/callback
auth.oauth.access_denied_error_page=/error-oauth

# Activates user self-service at the API level.
# Che has a single identity implementation, so this does not change the user experience.
# If true, enables user creation at API level
user.self.creation.allowed=false

# Remove locations where internal message bus events should be propagated to.
# For debugging - set to retrieve internal events from external clients.
notification.server.propagate_events=

# Che extensions can be scheduled executions on a time basis.
# This configures the size of the thread pool allocated to extensions that are launched on
# a recurring schedule.
schedule.core_pool_size=10

### Docker is the default machine implementation within Che. Workspaces are powered by machines
### that are constructed when the workspace is started. The images used to generate containers
### for the machines can come from DockerHub or a private Docker registry.
machine.docker.registry=${CHE_REGISTRY_HOST}:5000
machine.docker.snapshot.registry_namespace=NULL
machine.docker.unused_containers_cleanup_period_min=60

### Docker registry auth config example. Note that you can configure many registries with different names.
#docker.registry.auth.your_registry_name.url=https://index.docker.io/v1/
#docker.registry.auth.your_registry_name.username=user-name
#docker.registry.auth.your_registry_name.password=user-password

### Machine configuration.  Machines power workspaces. This configures the Che behaviors that
### occur within the machine.

# This archive contains the server to run the workspace agent and any custom extensions.
# Che injects this archive into machines when they are booted or started.

# When the workspace master launches a new workspace, Che performs checks of the internal Web
# services. When Che gets a valid response, we know that the workspace agent is ready for use.

machine.ws_agent.ping_conn_timeout_ms=2000
machine.ws_agent.ping_timed_out_error_msg=Timeout reached. The Che server has been unable to verify that your workspace's agent has successfully booted. Either the workspace is unreachable, the agent had an error during startup, or your workspace is starting slowly. You can configure machine.ws_agent.max_start_time_ms in Che properties to increase the timeout.

# Hosts listed here will be added to /etc/hosts of each workspace machine.
# Add an entry here if you write a ws-agent extension that needs to communicate outside the machine
machine.docker.machine_extra_hosts=NULL

# If this is true, then we always pull an image from a registry even if we have an image cached
# locally. If false, Docker only pulls image if it does not exist locally.

machine.docker.privilege_mode=false

# If the browser clients that are accessing Che are remote AND the configuration of Docker is an
# internal IP address or using Unix sockets, then remote browser clients will not be able to connect
# to the workspace. Set the Docker configuration so that Docker containers have an external IP
# address and provide this host or IP address here.

# otherwise workspace snapshots would be saved locally.

# Allows to adjust machine swap memory by multiplication current machnine memory on provided value.
# default is -1 which means unlimited swap, if set multiplier value equal to 0.5 machine swap will be
# configured with size that equal to half of current machine memory, to disable swap set it to 0.
